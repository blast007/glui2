== About ==

_[http://code.google.com/p/glui2/source/browse/trunk/Glui2/g2Spinner.h g2Spinner Header File]_

A floating-point or integer value incriminator or decrement button pair; derives from [g2Controller]. The on-screen text is rendered by a [g2TextField] which also attempts to parse user input if valid. The user may press the adjacent up or down buttons to either increase or decrease the g2TextField on-screen value.

== Factory Method ==

{{{
g2Spinner* AddSpinner(int x, int y, g2SpinnerType Type, __g2CallBack(callback) = 0, float* LiveValue = NULL)
}}}

_AddSpinner_ will internally allocate and manage a newly created g2Spinner. The given x and y integers are on-screen coordinates, assuming that the origin is the top left of the screen and that Y grows down and X grows right. The third argument is the type of the spinner, which will either be an integer-type (g2SpinnerType_Int) or a floating-point type (g2SpinnerType_Float). The fourth argument is a button-press callback event handler much like that found in [g2Button] but is optional. The final argument is a live-variable which will be updated at any time the user makes a change in the radio group, but is optional.

== Function Members ==

{{{
void SetOptions(const char** OptionLabels, int OptionCount)
}}}
Set the on-screen label options associated with each individual radio controller. The given OptionLabels is an array of c-strings (thus an array of character arrays) of OptionCount size, in order from index 0 to (OptionCount - 1) which is from top to bottom on-screen.

{{{
int GetSelectionIndex()
}}}
Return the currently selected index the user has made, which is from 0 to (OptionCount - 1) (top to bottom on-screen).

{{{
void SetLiveVariable(int* LiveIndex = NULL)
}}}
Attach a live index, which is a variable updated at run-time when the user makes any changes to the selected index in the radio group.

== Notes ==

Don't forget that you can set upper and lower bounds, as well as set the rate of change when a user presses either the increment or decrement buttons.
