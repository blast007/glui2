== About ==

_[http://code.google.com/p/glui2/source/browse/trunk/Glui2/g2Console.h g2Console Header File]_

A debugging console, much like a standard I/O console; derives from [g2Controller]. The on-screen text is rendered by using g2Controller character-rendering function members. The input is very similar to that of a [g2TextField].

== Factory Method ==

{{{
g2Console* AddConsole()
}}}

_AddConsole_ will internally allocate and manage a newly created g2Console. The console factory method does not take any arguments as none are needed; the console is purely a string input / output manager, similar to a debugging console.

== Function Members ==

{{{
void SetOptions(const char** OptionLabels, int OptionCount)
}}}
Set the on-screen label options associated with each individual radio controller. The given OptionLabels is an array of c-strings (thus an array of character arrays) of OptionCount size, in order from index 0 to (OptionCount - 1) which is from top to bottom on-screen.

{{{
int GetSelectionIndex()
}}}
Return the currently selected index the user has made, which is from 0 to (OptionCount - 1) (top to bottom on-screen).

{{{
void SetLiveVariable(int* LiveIndex = NULL)
}}}
Attach a live index, which is a variable updated at run-time when the user makes any changes to the selected index in the radio group.

== Notes ==

It may be easier to use the g2Console in an application than command-line as a tool for debugging at run-time. Any input given or output received from the console is redirected to the standard input / output streams.
