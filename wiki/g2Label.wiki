=== Temporary place holder ===

A text output; the text is generated and drawn using a bitmap. This bitmap is defined in the configuration file and must be mapped out as a 4bit x 4bit matrix. For example the letter 'A' is 0x41 so the higher nibble is 0x4 (0100) and the lower nibble is 0x1 (0001) and thus position (4, 1) in the table.
