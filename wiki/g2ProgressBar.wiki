== About ==

_[http://code.google.com/p/glui2/source/browse/trunk/Glui2/g2ProgressBar.h g2ProgressBar Header File]_

A bar that gets filled based on a progress variable; derives from [g2Controller].

== Factory Method ==

{{{
g2ProgressBar* AddProgressBar(int x, int y)
}}}

_AddProgressBar_ will internally allocate and manage a newly created g2ProgressBar. The given x and y integers are on-screen coordinates, assuming that the origin is the top left of the screen and that Y grows down and X grows right. By default the progress is set to 0.5 on a scale of [0, 1].

== Function Members ==

{{{
void SetOptions(const char** OptionLabels, int OptionCount)
}}}
Set the on-screen label options associated with each individual radio controller. The given OptionLabels is an array of c-strings (thus an array of character arrays) of OptionCount size, in order from index 0 to (OptionCount - 1) which is from top to bottom on-screen.

{{{
int GetSelectionIndex()
}}}
Return the currently selected index the user has made, which is from 0 to (OptionCount - 1) (top to bottom on-screen).

{{{
void SetLiveVariable(int* LiveIndex = NULL)
}}}
Attach a live index, which is a variable updated at run-time when the user makes any changes to the selected index in the radio group.

== Notes ==

Make sure to change your scale to help you when interfacing with a non-normalized value.
