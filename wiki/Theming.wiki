=== Themes ===
All theme files are a combination of three different files: a .cfg file describing the locations of each controller, a .png for the controller images themselves, as well as a .png for the character bitmap (used as a bitmap font). These three files can be named anything but must end in .cfg if it is the theme description file or .png if they are the image files. The source image files must be refereed in the configuration file, as described bellow.

Included in the project are two complete theme files: g2Default.cfg and g2Blue.cfg

=== Config Files ===
Configuration files closely resemble window's INI file format for simplicity and clarity. All keys must be in a group, and groups are defined as a string encased within brackets (i.e. group?). Group names are not case sensitive, and neither are key names. Data for each key can be anything, ranging from integers to strings, but it must be ascii-encoded (i.e. written in plain-text, not in native binary).

Example as follows:

{{{
 # This is a comment, started using a hash character
 [group_name]          # Group name of key-value pairs; do not use brackets within the name
 key1: Some data       # Example of key-value pair (or instead of ':' use '=')
 key2: More data
 key3: Any data!
 key: This is an example of multi-line text; the new line MUST either
      be tabbed or include 4 or more space characters.
}}}

The internal implementation is based on a linked-list of groups with each group having a linked-list of key-data pairs. Though this could be implemented as a hash-map, the goal of GLUI2 is to keep code simple and maintainable; adding the STL map struct is too unruly to work with, ugly, and big...

==== Configuration Variables ====
The follow are the group names and key values that are required for a theme. There are in total 11 controllers that need to be defined, but with some controllers having a "pressed" and / or "disabled" state that needs to be defined (for example a radio-button has four states). Each group requires a point and size integer-tuple keys to describe the origin of a theme area (position origin is top-left of the image where X grows to the right and Y grows to the bottom). You can have overlapping or reused segments.
